/*1. change Location signature to have list,
* but it has reveal index storage to client and new such object to retrieve data;
* 2. add metadata after bit block area, say integer block area,
* but when BLOCK_SIZE is smaller, BLOCK_COUNT is bigger, and the area will grow larger to take up actual storage space,
* good thing is easier for client to use since it only needs to know start block index
